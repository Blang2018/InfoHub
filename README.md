## About
This repo is going to serve as a hub so we can compile all the resources, issues and extra material we come across or generate and have them all organized away from actual project files.

## Organization
If you want to push a file, place in the appropriate directory, if one is not present, feel free to make one.

The wiki tab will have pages where you share links to repo files or websites, along with notes on anything pertinent.
